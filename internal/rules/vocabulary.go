package rules

// The argv vocabulary the DL30xx rules share. Around twenty rules match the
// same package-manager subcommands and flags, so the words are named once
// here, beside the per-manager binaries the rules that need only one keep
// locally (yumCommand, zypperCommand): a rule matches a literal or it
// silently stops firing, and a typo in a literal is invisible.
